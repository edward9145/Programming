# 1667. Interval Statistics
# cat-only-icon
# CAT Only
# ä¸­æ–‡English
# Given arr, an array of 01 and an integer k. You need to count how many intervals meet the following conditions:

# Both start and the end of the interval are 0 (allowing the length of the interval to be 1).
# The number of 1 in the interval is not more than k
# Example
# Example 1:

# Input: arr = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], k = 1
# Output: 7
# Explanation: [0, 0], [1, 1], [3, 3], [6, 6], [0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 3] (The interval [i, j] means the elements between index i(included) and index j(included))
# Example 2:

# Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], k = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation: [3, 3], [4, 4], [3, 4] (The interval [i, j] means the elements between index i(included) and index j(included))
# Notice
# The length of arr does not exceed 10^5

    """
    @param arr: the 01 array
    @param k: the limit 
    @return: the sum of the interval
